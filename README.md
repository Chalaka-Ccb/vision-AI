Vision AI in 5 Days: From Beginner to Image Recognition Expert

**Bootcamp by DevTown Community
Organized with **MSIT Student Chapter** & **Google Developer Groups**  

---

## 📜 Project Overview
This project was developed during the **Vision AI in 5 Days** bootcamp, aimed at transforming beginners into skilled AI practitioners.  
Over the course of 5 days, we built and deployed an **image recognition system** using **Python**, **TensorFlow/Keras**, and popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Cats vs Dogs).  

The final deliverable is a **deployable, real-time image classifier** with a clean web UI powered by **Gradio**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) from scratch
- Data augmentation and model evaluation
- Transfer learning with **MobileNetV2**
- Deploying a model with a simple web interface
- Creating portfolio-ready AI projects

## 📊 Datasets Used
1. **[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)** – 70,000 grayscale digit images (28×28)  
2. **[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)** – 60,000 color images in 10 classes (32×32)  
3. **[Cats vs Dogs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)** – 25,000 labeled images (resized to 224×224)
